      <!-- ------------------------Steps 2-3------------------------------ -->
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To inform the public of the temples and know what ordinance, where they are, what time they are open
          and the name of each temple is. We love it when people go to the temple
        to perform ordinances, pray, visit and possibly find answers
        to many of their prayers and questions. This website will help them
        find out the information necessary to attend and be apart of
        the House Of The Lord. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience I'm targeting are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
          so that they may be informed when the temple is open, where the temple is and what is being
          done in the temple. As well as what ordinances are being performed at this temple.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Style Guide
      </h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/8ed081-b4d2ba-dce2aa-b57f50-4b543b" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/8ed081-b4d2ba-dce2aa-b57f50-4b543b</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#FFFFFF]</td><td class="secondary">[#FFCC33]</td><td class="accent1">[#4ECDC4]</td><td class="accent2">[#66D7D1]</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: New Cycle  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
         This font is super cool to look at for me and really brings together all of the content. It is great. <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Lora  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font is quick to read, pleasing to the eyes and most of all is simple. I like it and it fits with the heading pretty well  <!-- change this -->
      </p>
      <!---------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Navigation
      </h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
