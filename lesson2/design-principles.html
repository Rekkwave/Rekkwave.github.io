        <p>Chartbeat made its website easy to use so that you can find what you need everytime.<br> They use alignment by aligning their images on the right side of the webpage. <br> The alignment really helps set the tone and focus of the whole webpage.</p>

          <p>Oddpears is a great website with lots of fun filled products and webpages. They accomplished contrast very well by making their own products contrast the webpage. This helps capture the interest of the visitor, causing them to want to explore the webpage and get hooked in.</p>

          <img src="/lesson2/images/whitespace.png" alt="">
          <p>Pocket Penguins does a great job following the rule of white space. They do it well by being minimalistic in their design choice. They decide to lay everything out vertically and let the page move while we scroll. This becomes more interactive for the viewer.</p>
